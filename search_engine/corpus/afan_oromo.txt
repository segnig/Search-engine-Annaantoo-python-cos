### INTRODUCTION

Computers and technologies are integral to life for most people, 
including those with physical disabilities. Improving and enhancing text entry 
and interaction with computers for users has been investigated for many years. 
However, for Afan Oromo, an under-resourced language, the development of such 
technology offers a great opportunity. The aim of this work was to explore 
Afan Oromo language structure (spelling, words, phrases, and sentences) and 
then develop an effective file editor, a plug-in for MS Word, to support 
text entry and input methods.

### OVERVIEW OF AFAN OROMO SCRIPT

Afan Oromo, also called Oromiffaa or Afaan Oromoo, is a 
member of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. It is the 
third most widely spoken language in Africa, after Hausa and Arabic, and is used 

by the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, the Oromo people, who make up about 50% 
of the population. Afan Oromo uses the Latin-based alphabet, Qubee, consisting of 
thirty-three basic letters: five vowels, twenty-four consonants, and seven paired 
letters (e.g., ‘CH’, ‘DH’, ‘NY’, ‘SH’, ‘TS’). 

### LANGUAGE STRUCTURE

Afan Oromo has a rich morphology and uses a subject-object-verb (SOV) 
sentence structure, unlike the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure of 
English. It also features unique punctuation usage, such as the apostrophe, 
which indicates a glottal stop sound. 

### PUNCTUATION MARKS

Punctuation marks in Afan Oromo are similar to those in English, with the exception 
of the apostrophe. In Afan Oromo, the apostrophe represents a glottal stop, 
unlike in English where it indicates possession.

### LITERATURE REVIEW

Research on facilitating computer interaction for users with physical disabilities 
has led to various tools and techniques. Word prediction and text entry methods 
have been proposed to assist such users. Previous research on Afan Oromo has focused 
on mobile text entry, but there is a need for a comprehensive solution integrated into 
widely used software like MS Word.

### MATERIALS AND METHOD

This research uses machine learning approaches, specifically unsupervised 
learning with N-gram algorithms (Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram). The steps include:

- Developing machine learning algorithms focusing on syntactic information.
- Developing N-gram algorithms tailored to user/domain-specific information.
- Integrating these learning mechanisms into a robust model.
- Applying the model to word prediction and completion.
- Testing and evaluating the system with physically disabled users.

### TRAINING DATA

Training data were collected from government media, cultural, historical, 
sports news, political, and economic documents in Afan Oromo.

### SIMULATION TOOLS

The algorithms were implemented in Java using NetBeans IDE 8.02. Java was 
chosen for its general-purpose nature, open-source availability, and platform independence.

### IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENT

The developed system integrates unsupervised learning with N-gram algorithms 
to produce robust techniques for file editing. It enhances MS Word functionality 
with a plug-in that supports Afan Oromo. The system provides faster and more efficient 
text entry, reduces cognitive load, and supports users with physical disabilities. 

### RESULTS

The file editor improves text entry speed and accuracy by predicting and 
completing words. It is particularly beneficial for typists and users 
with physical disabilities. The tool has additional functionalities, 
such as word prediction, making it easier to create and edit documents
 in Afan Oromo.

### CONCLUSION

This work introduces a file editor tool for Afan Oromo, 
enhancing text entry and input methods for users. The integration 
into MS Word brings significant benefits, especially for users with 
disabilities, by providing an efficient way to interact with computers using their native language.
